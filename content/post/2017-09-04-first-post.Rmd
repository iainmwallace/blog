Setting up your own blog is very easy using Rstudio and blogdown
  
Steps in setting up this site

1. Install blogdown - devtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')
2. For first site, install hugo - blogdown::install_hugo()
3. blogdown::hugo_build() 
4. create site blogdown::new_site()
5. modify links in config.toml
5. create account on https://www.netlify.com/
6. upload public folder
7. optional: used netlify DNS to point to a custom domain (I use namecheap)  
8. optional: built site directly from github [CI details](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html)
